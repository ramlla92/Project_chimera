# Project Chimera – Agent Rules

## 1. Project Context

- This repository is a **spec‑driven, test‑first blueprint** for Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system.
- The goal is to define structure, specifications, skill interfaces, failing tests, Docker, and CI that future agents can safely build on, **not** to implement the full production Chimera OS.[file:1]

## 2. Prime Directives

- Always read the relevant files in `specs/` (and the SRS in `docs/`) before proposing or generating any code, tests, or configurations.[file:1]
- Do not introduce new behaviors, skills, or APIs that are not described or clearly implied in the specs/SRS; if needed, propose a spec change first.
- If you detect a mismatch between specs and behavior, explicitly call it out and suggest a concrete update to `specs/` before changing tests or code.

## 3. Challenge Scope (Avoid Over‑Engineering)

- Treat this as a **3‑day challenge repository**: focus on repo layout, specs, conceptual agent roles, API/data schemas, skill interfaces, failing tests, Docker, and CI.[file:1]
- Do **not** design or describe full Swarm orchestration loops, detailed MCP servers, Coinbase AgentKit flows, or production deployment unless explicitly requested.
- Do **not** assume or create extra directories or abstractions (e.g., `drivers/`, complex base classes, Redis loops, Pydantic models) unless they are explicitly needed for this repo.
- When unsure whether something belongs here or only in the long‑term SRS, ask, and by default keep `specs/` scoped to what this repository must define.

## 4. Use of Project Documents

- Use the SRS in `docs/` to understand high‑level vision, business models, and actors.[file:1]
- Use `specs/_meta.md` for this repo’s scope, constraints, and non‑goals, and align your suggestions with it.
- Use `specs/functional.md` for user stories and acceptance criteria; derive behaviors and tests from there.
- Use `specs/technical.md` for API contracts, data structures, and storage schemas; keep interfaces and tests consistent with these definitions.
- Use `specs/openclaw_integration.md` when reasoning about agent social/network protocols and external coordination.
- Use `skills/` to define and refine runtime skill interfaces (inputs/outputs); do not invent new skills without updating this directory.
- Use `tests/` as the executable expression of expected behavior; update specs and tests together before implementation.

## 5. Working Style and Expectations

- Before any substantial change, briefly state your plan in 3–5 bullet points and reference specific spec/SRS sections.
- Work in small, incremental steps (one concern or file at a time) so changes remain easy to review and trace.
- When information is missing or ambiguous, ask targeted clarification questions or propose specific spec additions instead of guessing.
- Prefer deterministic, testable designs and explicit interfaces over “prompt‑only” behavior or hidden assumptions.

## 6. Safety, Governance, and Commerce

- Assume Human‑in‑the‑Loop and CI review for actions that publish content or move money, even if those flows are only modeled in specs.[file:1]
- Highlight security, privacy, or multi‑tenant isolation risks when proposing changes related to content, data, or commerce.
- Do not add external services, MCP servers, or financial capabilities without justification and a corresponding update to `specs/` and (optionally) `docs/decisions.md`.

## 7. Collaboration and Traceability

- Link every new feature or change to at least one user story or requirement from the SRS and/or `specs/functional.md`.
- When generating tests, state which spec or requirement each test validates, preferably in comments or test names.
- Write commit messages that clearly reflect spec or behavior changes (e.g., `feat: add trend fetcher API per technical spec`).
